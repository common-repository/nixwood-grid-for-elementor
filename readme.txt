== Description ==
Nixwood Grid for Elementor allows you to improve page structure designing experience through the fancy Grid, built with Nixwood inside Elementor default \"Sections\" or \"Inner Sections\" widget.
A grid will have 3% margin between all columns so that margins will be the same for all websites. You don't need to adjust margins between columns anymore, it doesn't matter if it's 2,3,4, or 5 columns - margins will be the same.

== Installation ==
Upload plugin archive, unzip it and run installation. 
Installing from repository - click \"Install\", wait until installation is completed and press \"Activate\" button next to plugin name.
Inside 'Section' or 'Inner Section' in Layout tab - you will see checkbox in the bottom 'Space between columns', check it, choose number of columns and that's it. If you want to use Different layout structure - check 'Bootstrap' and choose structure that you want.
